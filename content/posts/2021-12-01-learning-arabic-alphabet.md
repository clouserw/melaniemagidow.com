This post is inspired by the many people I hear from who want to begin learning Arabic. If you’re interested in finding a program, check out my earlier post on [Arabic Study Options](https://www.melaniemagidow.com/2021/06/01/arabic-study-options/). It includes a collection of resources. For those who just want to get their feet wet, so to speak, just taking baby steps into the alphabet and Arabic, here are some ideas for you:

- I have a brief Overview of the Arabic Language [here](https://www.melaniemagidow.com/2020/11/02/the-arabic-language-an-overview/).
- There’s a FREE beginning online Arabic course you can explore at your own pace (not interactive) available[ here](https://qfi.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d82d3f97985fc0799a5b2299e&id=3dc36e46d0&e=ad91916ae5). This is funded by the US Department of Education. There is no registration, payment, or “bonus content.” 
- For those of you with a Mac device, I recommend this alphabet workbook available free on Books: [https://books.apple.com/us/book/lets-explore-arabic-alphabet/id879152581](https://books.apple.com/us/book/lets-explore-arabic-alphabet/id879152581) .

4. Adam wa-Mishmish Alphabet Song: This catchy song is a favorite for kids of all ages!
