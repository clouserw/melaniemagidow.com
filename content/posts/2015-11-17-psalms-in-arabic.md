In response to the recent violence in Beirut and Paris, I offer this video featuring the music, philosophy, and singing of Sister Marie Keyrouz, a Lebanese Catholic nun who sings in Arabic. For more, see her [website](http://www.keyrouz.com/index.html).

Also, I recommend this article: [A Muslim Woman’s First Thoughts After the Paris Attacks](http://muslimgirl.net/16011/thoughts-after-paris-attack/) by Hasnaa Mokhtar. She does an excellent job of showing why Muslims should not be held responsible for terrorist attacks. When mainstream American culture embraces Islamophobia, it holds Muslims hostage and endangers the humanity of all of us.
