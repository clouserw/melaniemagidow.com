I’m happy to announce the new free Arabic teaching module co-created by myself and Laila Familiar on Khallina.org available [here](http://khallina.org/across-borders/). ![](/images/91355-coverimage.png)

> 

In this module, we investigate transnational social issues in the Arab World through literature and graphic art. These issues include: refugees and refugee camps, fleeing violence, immigration, cultural challenges for immigrants, studying abroad, and making choices about where and how to live one’s life. IN THIS MODULE, LEARNERS WILL:

- <i></i> Meet an artist who addresses social issues through comix

- <i></i> Read a short story that contains big ideas

- <i></i> Listen to a sung poem expressing solidarity with displaced people

- <i></i> Learn about the perspectives of young people from refugee families
