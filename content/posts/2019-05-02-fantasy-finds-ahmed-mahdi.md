I recommend anything by [Ahmed Salah Al-Mahdi](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15639908.Ahmed_Salah_Al_Mahdi?from_search=true),  a bright new talent in the Arab World. His books provide great  suspense, enchanting world building, satisfying storylines, and  compelling characters.See [here](http://ahmedmahdi.net/) for his website, and [here](http://www.islamscifi.com/islam-and-sci-fi-interview-of-ahmed-al-mahdi/) and [here](https://arablit.org/2018/09/01/ahmed-al-mahdi-on-writing-young-adult-literature-in-egypt/) for two interviews with him.

Malaz: City of Resurrection

###### My mini-review of *Malaz*, a futuristic novel

In this book, the plot was unpredictable in the beginning. It surprised me more than once! Eventually it was clear where the story was going, but the beginning set up space for multiple possible directions. In a sequel, it would be fun to see another possible direction explored (for example, the protagonist’s personal relationships, or the politics of various groups of people within Malaz or outside of it, or a journey through different parts of this world). The protagonist character learns, grows, and succeeds. In a sequel, it would be fun to see this character develop even more, as well as the character Jihad. I enjoyed the imaginary, futuristic Egypt. In a sequel, I would like to read even more about the landscape.

At the end of this book, I want more! I hope to see a sequel some day! However, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in an imaginative, fun story. It includes adventure, revenge, coming-of-age, and a hint of romance!

[**Update**: The [prequel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37838855) (الشتاء الأسود / Black Winter ) is now available, although I have yet to read it.]
