In this post, I’m delighted to introduce you to a major textile art happening today: Khayamiyya (Appliqué) of Egypt. Next month we’ll follow up with embroidery arts. Let me know if there are other arts you’d like to see in future posts. For example, anyone here want to write or read about caftan fashions of Morocco? Another topic familiar to those who knit or crochet is “Tunisian crochet.” As far as I know, this technique and its name have nothing to do with Tunisia (source [here](https://www.irishfibrecrafters.com/news/2020/6/11/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-about-tunisian-crochet)), but tell me if you know better!

## Khayamiyya (Appliqué) of Egypt

This distinctive art derives from the creation of tents (*khayamiyya* means roughly ‘tent art’ or ‘tent work’), dating from the Fatimid period (909-1171). Other theories trace *khayamiyya *to ancient Egypt. In any case, the designs certainly reflect various artistic influences from Egyptian history (such as lotus flowers from ancient Egypt, as well as biomorphic floral patterns and Arabic calligraphy, both popular throughout Islamic art). Since the 17th century, these works of art have been produced and sold in the covered market street called *Khayamiyya* (“Street of the Tentmakers”) in old Cairo. This decorative art is traditional for Ramadan tents (fabulous surroundings for holiday events, such as festive performances and lavish banquets, as well as other occasions for social gatherings). On a smaller scale, these textiles are often used for wall hangings and pillows. The designs are also used to decorate items generally, such as mugs and refrigerator magnets.

Khayamiyya consists of hand-stitched cotton appliqué over a heavy cotton back. To see how this art is done, check out this very informative demo video:
