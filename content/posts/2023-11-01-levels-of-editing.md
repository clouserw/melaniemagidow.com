The world of professional editing includes a variety of services, most of which can be envisioned as a series of levels. At each step in the editing process, the editor approaches the text from a different level, providing a piece of its transformation from raw ideas into polished content. Some texts need more work in certain areas than others, but every text will benefit from some form of editing. In this blog post, I aim to provide an overview of the stages of editing, based on the process generally followed by publishers.

## Developmental Editing

Also known as substantive editing, this is the first and most comprehensive level of editing. It’s a global, overall consideration of the text as a whole. At this stage, the editor works closely with the author to shape the overall structure, content, and style of the manuscript. This type of editing focuses on the big picture, addressing issues such as:

- **For Nonfiction:** Concept (choice of topic and expression of the main problem or question), Argument (engaging, with information organized logically), Documentation (drawing on relevant studies, demonstrating familiarity with a field of inquiry)

- **For Fiction:** Plot and Storyline (engaging, coherent), Character Development (well-rounded, relatable, consistent), Pacing (keeping readers engaged)

- **For All:** Clarity and Voice (refining the author’s unique writing style and ensuring it aligns with the intended audience).

Developmental editing may involve extensive revisions and rewrites. It’s a collaborative process, with the editor providing guidance and feedback to help the author realize their vision.

## Structural/Line Editing and Copyediting

This category is sometimes broken into two steps, with the first focused on structure and flow (syntax, word use, rhythm) and the second focused on mechanics (spelling, grammar, punctuation, style). In my work, I tend to address these issues together when working with authors, determined by what the text needs. When working with publishers, I find out what is desired by the editorial team and let that guide my suggestions and changes. Key tasks include:

- **Paragraph and Sentence Structure:** Ensuring that paragraphs are well-constructed, sentences are clear, and transitions between ideas are smooth.

- **Consistency:** Checking for consistency in terminology, tone, and formatting throughout the document.

- **Grammar and Syntax:** Correcting grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and subject-verb agreement issues.

- **Punctuation and Capitalization:** Ensuring proper usage of punctuation marks and consistent capitalization (hyphenation, treatment of numbers, quotations, etc.).

- **Style Consistency:** Adhering to a specific style guide (in my case, usually the Chicago Manual of Style) and maintaining consistency throughout the document. For scholarly writing, this can include checking documentation (checking that all sources are cited as needed, in notes and/or bibliography).

Structural editing aims to enhance the overall readability and coherence of the manuscript. Copyediting aims to polish the manuscript to ensure it meets the highest standards of language and clarity. When I combine these into one service, I ensure that the text flows clearly, at the level of the sentence and the paragraph, and that it is presented correctly.

## Proofreading

Proofreading is the final step in the editing process and is focused on eliminating minor errors and typos, giving the manuscript one last quality check before publication. This occurs after the manuscript has been typeset. Tasks include:

- **Spelling and Typographical Errors:** Correcting any remaining spelling mistakes, typographical errors, or inconsistencies.

- **Formatting:** Ensuring that the document adheres to the specified formatting guidelines (font, margins, spacing).

- **Page Numbers and Headers/Footers:** Confirming that page numbers and headers/footers are correctly formatted.

Proofreading ensures that the manuscript is free of egregious errors and ready for publication.

## Additional Services

- **Citations:** Some editors will check to make sure that all sources mentioned in the text are cited, and vice versa. This can include looking up each source to make sure it is cited properly (spelling of author name, title, correct numbers and dates). This can also include formatting all citations according to a particular style guide (in my case, this is generally the Chicago Manual of Style).

- **Research:** Some editors will provide fact-checking, Subject Matter Expertise (SME), or research to improve a publication.

- **Multilingual:** Some editors will provide translation and/or transliteration services. Sometimes it is important to have translations or transliteration checked as part of the editing process to prevent any mistakes or typos.

- **Indexing:** Generally for nonfiction books, an indexer (who is sometimes also an editor) will create an index to be placed at the end of the book to help readers look up specific information or get a sense of the topics covered in a book.

From developmental editing, which shapes the concept and overall structure of the text, to copyediting and proofreading, which refine the language and presentation, each level of editing plays a vital role in the journey from rough draft to final publication.
