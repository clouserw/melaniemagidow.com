Have you ever heard a poem performed live in such a way that it captured your whole attention?

There are tons of amazing poetry performances in Arabic, both spoken and sung.

**[Al-Ta’shira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTxhW4E752Y)**

This is my all-time favorite spoken poem performance. Sorry, I don’t have time to translate it now…maybe later! The poet is Hesham El Gakh from Egypt, and the venue is [Prince of Poets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Poets) in the UAE, the biggest live Arabic poetry venue. It’s more competitive and high-profile than American Idol because it’s international, bringing together contestants from throughout the Arab World. The poem created [quite a stir](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/prince-of-poets-competitor-causes-stir).

For anyone wanting a similar experience in English, I can recommend Palestinian-American poet Suheir Hammad [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/suheir_hammad_poems_of_war_peace_women_power).

For sung poetry, there are quite a few famous poet-singer teams. [Umm Kulthum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Kulthum) sang poems by [Mahmud Bayram El-Tunsi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Bayram_el-Tunsi) and other poets. For an example, check out [Ana fi Intizarak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-0qSSe_NF0) / I’m Waiting for You, starting at 2:10. Lyrics in English and Arabic [here](http://www.shira.net/music/lyrics/ana-fi-inta-zarak.htm).
