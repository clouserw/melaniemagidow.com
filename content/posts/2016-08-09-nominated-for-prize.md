“…couldn’t put the book down. I felt richly immersed in a culture and atmosphere I barely know. The characters are so alive! I love how you left some words untranslated and unexplained, preserving the foreignness of the text and leaving it to [the] reader to imagine the meaning.”

(from personal communication with an Italian to English translator who found my book through the New England Translators Association annual conference in April 2019)
