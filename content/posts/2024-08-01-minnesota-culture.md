When I moved to Minnesota two years ago, I suddenly had a whole new world to learn and explore, from highways and county roads to social values and cultural norms. Along the way, I’ve found some books and other cultural artifacts that have enhanced the journey and I’m sharing them with you here today. The cultural diversity of the Twin Cities area that you’ll see reflected below includes Native American Indian, Hmong, Scandinavian, Somali, and other elements.
