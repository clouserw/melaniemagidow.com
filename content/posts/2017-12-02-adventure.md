Here’s to travel, expanding one’s horizons, and taking on new challenges!

My friend Barbara Romaine recently published a series of poems [here](http://www.bu.edu/pusteblume/7/issue-3-romaine.htm), including the following celebration of roaming (Arabic [here](http://www.bu.edu/pusteblume/7/issue-3-romaine-arabic.pdf)).

## Wanderlust

*by al-Imam al-Shafiʿi (d. 820), translated by Barbara Romaine*
</br>

To a mind wise and cultured, what ease in a place?
</br>
Pull up stakes, leave your country, and roam!
</br>
Those you meet on your travels will make up the loss
</br>
Of those left behind you at home.

Water by its own stillness made foul have I seen;
</br>
It can only stay sweet when it flows.
</br>
There’s no prey for the lion that ventures not forth;
</br>
No mark for arrows stuck in bows.

Should the sun in its heavenly orbit stop short,
</br>
One and all we would tire of its blaze;
</br>
If the moon never set but stood still in the sky,
</br>
It would draw not the eye’s eager gaze.

Much like scattered dust lie the earth’s lodes of ore;
</br>
Reeds to burn grow in numbers untold.
</br>
The latter remove, and you’ll want it; the former,
</br>
When rare, is no less than pure gold.
