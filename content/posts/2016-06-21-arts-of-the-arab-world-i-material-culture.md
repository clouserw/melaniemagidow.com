I have read a lot about the glorious accomplishments of “the Arabs” or “the Muslims” in the distant past. Instead of focusing on some mythic golden age, this site includes any material culture that I find beautiful and noteworthy. So while some examples are historical, some are contemporary.

For some incredibly beautiful historic art and architecture photos and information on patterns, see [here](http://patterninislamicart.com/).

## Pottery<a href="/images/704fd-pottery.jpg">![pottery](/images/704fd-pottery.jpg)</a>

One of my favorite pieces of art is a blue and white [lamp](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/?p=566) from the sixteenth century. For some contemporary ceramics that I think are well worth checking out, see the work of [Myriam Mourabit](http://brownbook.me/down-to-earth/) (Rabat, Morocco).

## Woodwork<a href="/images/1217c-nadimcat.jpg">![NadimCat](/images/1217c-nadimcat.jpg)</a>

One of the most distinctive kinds of woodwork in the Arab World is [mashrabiyya](http://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0458), latticed screens traditionally fitted together without any adhesive or hardware. Historically, they developed as a strategy for comfort and privacy so that urban families could enjoy fresh air from the outdoors without exposing themselves to public scrutiny. For contemporary woodwork, I can recommend [Nadim](http://www.nadim.org/) (Cairo, Egypt).

## Painting / Drawing

One of the most valued arts throughout the Islamic world is calligraphy. See [here](http://islamicartsmagazine.com/magazine/view/contemporary_islamic_calligraphy_exhibition_nun_wa_al_qalam/) for the highlights from a contemporary calligraphy exhibition in Malaysia. This site has featured the work of [Moataz Nasr](http://arttattler.com/archivemoataznasr.html) of Cairo [here](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/2015/09/06/love-in-a-dark-corner/).
