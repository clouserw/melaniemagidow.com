### Time Periods & Parameters of Arabic Literature

In the field of Arabic literature, courses are usually designed as either “Modern” or “Classical.” The former refers to roughly the 19th century and later, with works considered “early modern” until around the time of the Second World War. “Modern” signifies a time when Arabic literature was in contact with colonial nations, and it is used to refer to literature until the present day. Pre-Modern or “Classical” Arabic literature begins with the (oral) poetry of 7th century Arabia, and continues into the global Middle Ages or medieval period, ending with roughly the nineteenth century and the colonial and industrial ages. The “golden age” of “Classical” Arabic literature ends around the 14th century, with the 15th to 18th centuries being a bit of a gray area. They are “Pre-Modern,” and fall under “Classical” for the purposes of teaching, but the literature in these centuries has been denigrated historically in both Arab and non-Arab scholarship for several reasons, including the increasing appearance of spoken language varieties in written sources. One problem with this structuring of the field is the preference of written sources over oral sources. In my work, I seek to provide a more balanced view of literature as inclusive of language arts across a culture, from poetry and plays to stories and songs, as well as novels and films. This vision is reflected in the syllabi below.
