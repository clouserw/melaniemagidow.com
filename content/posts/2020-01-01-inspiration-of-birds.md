With this bright new year of 2020, I’m sharing a few literary/artistic picks (two books and one music album) that were recently inspired by *Conference of the Birds* (منطق الطير), the allegorical poem by Farid al-Din Attar (lived in Nishapur c. 1145-c. 1221, in northeastern Iran). 

“Considered by Rumi to  be ‘the master’ of Sufi mystic poetry, Attar is best known for this epic  poem, a magnificent allegorical tale about the soul’s search for  meaning. He recounts the perilous journey of the world’s birds to the  faraway peaks of Mount Qaf in search of the mysterious Simorgh, their  king. Attar’s beguiling anecdotes and humor intermingle the sublime with  the mundane, the spiritual with the worldly, while his poem models the  soul’s escape from the mind’s rational embrace.” – from Goodreads description [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187179-the-conference-of-the-birds?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=OkPTTjWjmM&rank=1)

*A journey toward guidance*

*[Bird Summons](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41050964-bird-summons)*, latest novel by Leila Aboulela, tells the tale of three women who set out on a journey together in Scotland. “On a remote hillside  in Inverness, each woman is visited by the Hoopoe, a sacred bird who  comes with fables from Muslim literature and Celtic folklore, forcing  the women to question how much they have sacrificed in the name of love.  

*Bird Summons* is a haunting, fiercely compelling story of  loyalties torn apart when love and religion, faith and culture collide –  confirming Leila Aboulela as a leading storyteller of our times.” (from the Goodreads description)

This book is on my to-read list for 2020!

*unity across social divisions, strength from togetherness, the search for courage in the face of adversity, and the breathtaking beauty that is present in this world*

*The Bird King* draws on several literary traditions. First, it is a historical novel set in medieval Spain, during the period in which the Castilians overthrew the Muslim kingdom of Andalucia. In 1492, the last Muslim ruler was forced to surrender Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella. This is also the time of the Spanish Inquisition, which Ferdinand and Isabella established in 1478. G. Willow Wilson draws on this history to create characters of varying religious identities, ethnicities, genders, and social status. Reimagining the past, she tells a story for today.
