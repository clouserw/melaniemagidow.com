Dear Barbara Dick and other sci-fi fans:

Check out [this page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sindbad-Sci-Fi/1386216074941672) for the sci fi salon that will be kicking off the annual [Nour Festival of Arts](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/nour/events/talks.aspx).

Their announcement features a great piece of art by [Murat Palta](http://www.behance.net/muratpalta) depicting Star Wars as a traditional miniature painting. The artist also has miniatures of movies such as Kill Bill, The Godfather, and other classics.
