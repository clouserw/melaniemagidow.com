##  Music

Some of my favorite contemporary Moroccan artists:

- Nass El Ghiwane – see [Brownbook](http://brownbook.me/nass-el-ghiwane/) post

- Oum – see [Brownbook](http://brownbook.me/oum/) post

- Nabyla Maan

See [here](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/2015/11/17/psalms-in-arabic/) for a concert of psalms sung in Arabic, performed by Lebanese Catholic nun Sister Marie Keyrouz.

##  Poetry and Oral Compositions

The oldest extant example of Arabic literature is poetry, composed and performed orally. [Here](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/?p=257) is a 9th century poem in English translation.

See [here](http://cordite.org.au/translations/montgomery-nuwas/) for James Montgomery’s translations of “Horse, Hawk, and and Cheetah: Three Arabic Hunting Poems by Abu Nuwas” (from the early 9th c.)

Check out [this post](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=644&action=edit&message=6) for spoken word of the present day.

The most influential example of Arabic literature is the Qur’an, the sacred text of Islam, and it too was recited orally. German scholar Angelika Neuwirth has written of the Qur’an as a “late antique text” that emphasizes knowledge. See [here](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/?p=538) for more on the implications of her work.

##  Public Culture

In addition to poetry, [aphorisms](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/arts-of-the-arab-world/oral-culture/quotes/), and tales, oral culture can also include [rumors](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/?p=203) that mold public discourses.

Broader than oral culture, public culture can include almost any art. Here are more resources on public culture in specific areas:

[Egypt](http://popular-culture.org/)

[Moroccan Malhun (Sung) Poetry](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/arts-of-the-arab-world/oral-culture/recordings/)

(*more to be added later*).
