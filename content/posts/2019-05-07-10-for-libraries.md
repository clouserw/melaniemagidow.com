I’ve been pondering what my “10 for Libraries” list would look like ever since M. Lynx Qualey and Ursula discussed “[Where to Start](https://arablit.org/2019/02/12/bulaq-27-start-here/)”
 (reading Arabic literature) on the Bulaq podcast, and as I’ve been 
seeing the various “10 for Libraries” lists posted on Arablit.org (first
 in the series [here](https://arablit.org/2019/02/26/new-library-recommendation-project-10-from-emily-drumsta/)).

1. Novel: *The Open Door* by Latifa Zayaat – The classic feminist  novel in Arabic. Set in 1940s-50s Egypt during anti-colonial struggles.  A highly developed main character, showing her shifting relationships  to family members, romantic partners, and her nation.

2.  Historical Novel: *Granada* by Radwa Ashour (or her short novel, *Siraaj*,  or non-fiction *The Journey*,
 recently translated by Michelle Hartman). This is probably my all-time 
favorite author in Arabic because she pays attention to narrative plots 
and developing characters, as well as describing the scene and exploring
 concepts. Characters tend to range in ages from children to the 
elderly, and tend to be diverse in many other ways as well.

3. Novella: *Returning to Haifa* by Ghassan Kanafani – This is a 
short novel on the human experience of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
 I recommend it because Kanafani represents the humanity of all those 
affected by this conflict.

4. Romance: *Girls of Riyadh* or *Mortal Designs*. Both focus on girls and women navigating society (the former is young Saudi women and the latter is an Egyptian widow).

5. YA: *The Green Bicycle* (or *The Hedgehog* by Zakariya Tamer, *The Servant* by Fatima Sharafeddine, *Always Coca-Cola* by Alexandra Chreiteh or *I Want to Get Married* by Ghada Abdel Aal)

6. Graphic Novel: *I Remember Beirut* by Zeina Abirached (also consider *The Illustrator’s Notebook*, a beautiful and brilliant by Mohieddine Ellabbad)

7. Children’s: *The Sandwich Swap* by Queen Rania of Jordan

8.  Pre-Modern Classics and Folklore: *Arabian Nights* translated  by Husain Haddawy (available in 2 volumes, depending on the edition)   if you don’t already have a good version in your library system. If you  do, consider *The  Story of Layla and Majnun* by Nizami Ganjavi  (admittedly Persian  literature, but from a time and space when Arab and  Persian societies were mixed). Folklore options: *Abu Jmeel’s Daughter*, *Arab Folktales* or *Pearls on a Branch*, the latter both translated by Inea Bushnaq. As an American who grew up in a monolingual English-speaking household, and who has been reading and studying Arabic almost twenty years, these classics and folklore selections are old favorites that I recommend as accessible for all those interested in the subject.

9. History: *The Adventures of Ibn Battuta* by Ross E. Dunn. Most Americans have never heard of Ibn Battuta, but have some interest in travel. Read this book and learn about the travels of perhaps the most-traveled person in history!

10.  Anthologies: *Modern Arabic Fiction* by Salma Khadra Jayussi or pre-modern Arabic literary anthology *Night & Horses & the Desert* by Robert Irwin
