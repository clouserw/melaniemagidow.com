During this time of social-distancing, my husband and I take turns spending time with our preschool-age son and working in my home office. I’ve been doing lots of coloring, which provides the illustrations for today’s post.

For those of you who want to study Arabic, or know someone who wants to work on their Arabic, I have collected all the program announcements that I have received for Remote Arabic offerings [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nf_3-vYLI7rlaqcGI5J8GmdDvf-jTxB4). These include:

- AALIM (based in Morocco)

- Amideast (with offerings based in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, and Jordan)

- AUB (based in Beirut)

- CET (based in Amman)

- Hedayet (based in Cairo)

- Hunter (based in NY) *includes a course in Palestinian Culture*
- Middlebury (based in VT)

- SILMW (based at University of Illinois)

- Other Online Arabic Study Options

Of course with remote learning, it does not matter where the program is based. However, you might want to choose a program based in a country with a dialect that you would like to pick up. Perhaps you would like to spend some time in that country in the future.

Some of these programs offer scholarships so be sure to read through the details, and if it is not specified and would make a difference for you, feel free to contact the program for more information regarding this aspect.
