I’m delighted to announce the publication of my new book, *The Tale of Princess Fatima, Warrior Woman: The Arabic Epic of Dhat al-Himma*. This handy book contains carefully selected episodes from the longest extant Arabic epic, and the only one named for a woman. Below is a photo of the seven volumes that comprise the original Arabic text.

- “My book of the year . . . This is a super fun tale. . . . It is really interesting . . . in the ways it plays with gender and race. . . . If you’re looking for a new primary source to get people interested in the Middle Ages in your classes, you really should consider this book. It really has a nice, interesting mix of societal commentary, fun medieval stuff, medieval warfare stuff, and different kinds of things that you couldn’t get in, say, The Song of Roland. . . . It’s something I think that people will want to read just in the same way that people like to read these Norse epics, like Egil’s Saga or even the chivalric romances. . . . I’ve read it twice now, and I’ve really enjoyed it.” ―Peter Konieczny, Medievalists.net podcast
