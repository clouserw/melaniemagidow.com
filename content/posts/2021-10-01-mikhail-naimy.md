Mikhail Naimy (1889-1998), an Arab-American who served in the U.S. army in WWI, wrote the following poem in 1924 to provide hope and support to fellow immigrants. I include it here today as a reminder to all of us to pause when we are faced with challenges. I understand “close your eyes” here as a call to look inside or to be mindful of the present moment to gain a new perspective. It’s also a reminder of the rich literary heritage of the Arab Diaspora.

When clouds conceal your skies,

Close your eyes;

And see the stars beyond.

If earth is wrapped with snow,

Close your eyes;

And see the flowers below.

When sickness knows no ease,

Close your eyes;

And see the cure in the disease.

And when the tomb gapes wide,

Close your eyes;

And see the cradle of life inside.

Note: English translation by J.R. Perry, although I changed the last line from “And see the cradle there inside” to “And see the cradle of life inside” (wanting to keep the “life” reference from the Arabic).
