I’m writing in response to mlynxqualey’s recent [post](http://arablit.wordpress.com/2014/09/01/teaching-resources-for-young-readers-a-free-online-list-in-progress/). She provides some great suggestions, and I just wanted to add my two cents:

**Classical Poetry:** Marcia limits her list to only materials that are free and available online. I agree with her recommendations of Khalidi’s translations of [Al-Buhturi’s “The Poet and the Wolf”](http://angryarab.blogspot.com/2013/01/arabic-poetry-in-translation-by-tarif.html) and [Al-Ma‘arri’s “A Rain Cloud.](http://angryarab.blogspot.com/2013/01/arabic-poetry-in-translation-by-tarif.html)” Then, instead of Arberry’s translation, I highly recommend [Desert Tracings: Six Classic Arabian Odes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/912766.Desert_Tracings?from_search=true), translated by Michael A. Sells. The translations and explanations are much more accessible, and this slim volume should be very affordable.

**Modern Poetry:** I would add Mahmoud Darwish’s poem To My Mother, which is free online in places such as [here](http://blogs.transparent.com/arabic/to-my-mother/). I also highly recommend showing a [video of Marcel Khalife’s sung rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB_YKodKoJ4) because he broadens the poem’s audience exponentially. Also, especially for high school and older, I recommend Ahmed Fouad Negm’s poetry of political opposition and free speech. There is a free book of his poems available at the bottom-left corner on [this page](http://www.princeclausfund.org/index.php/en/library/library/i-say-my-words-out-loud-by-ahmed-fouad-negm.html).

**Classical Fiction:** If you can use a book (instead of online materials only), then I highly recommend the imaginative tales in [The Adventures of Sayf ben dhi Yazan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1774149.The_Adventures_of_Sayf_Ben_Dhi_Yazan?from_search=true) or [Tales of Juha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101986.Tales_of_Juha) or this anthology of [Classical Arabic Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9724531-classical-arabic-stories).

**Contemporary Fiction:** If you can use books, then I recommend short stories by Salwa Bakr, and the novella by Radwa Ashour, [Siraaj: An Arab Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3377038-siraaj?from_search=true), translated by Barbara Romaine.
