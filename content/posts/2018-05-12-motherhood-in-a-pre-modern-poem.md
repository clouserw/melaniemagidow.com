As a fairly recent new mother (since Aug. 2016), I am still navigating the exhilarating ups and downs of life with a young child. So when the opening of this poem appeared in a recent translation project, I snatched it to share here:

## Life is fleeting, so use it to honor your parents
</br>
First and foremost, your mother
## The pressures of pregnancy and breastfeeding
</br>
Sustain the welfare of all human beings
## Even kings must respect and heed them:
</br>
Earthly kings are merely sparkling rain

– The first three lines of a six-line poem by [Abu ‘Ala’ al-Ma‘arri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%CA%BFarri), 973-1057,
