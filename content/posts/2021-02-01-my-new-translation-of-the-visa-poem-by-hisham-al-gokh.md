Hisham al-Gokh gave a stunning live performance of this poem – see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQe41B8eytY). When this poem first came out, several years ago, it captured my attention with its simplicity and its brave criticism. He points the finger of blame at authorities in the Arab region, but there is also a note of self-criticism.

It’s time to post a new translation of this poem *now* because this is a powerful poem about tackling problems in one’s own society, owning up to the failure of childhood dreams and empty ideologies, and giving voice to the dreams that live on and provide hope for a better future for all.

Below is my translation in English. You can contact me for the Arabic original or find it online somewhere such as [here](https://hoggar.org/2011/01/29/%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AE/). I don’t normally post the translations I make in the course of work for clients (in this case, creating a bilingual Arabic/English literary corpus for a US college), but I’m making an exception because this is such a timely poem. Enjoy!

***The Visa***
**Hisham al-Gokh, Translated by Melanie Magidow**

I praise your name, God, *Allahu*

I fear none but you

I know I have a fate that I will meet—we will meet

As a child, I was taught that it was my honor to have Arab identity

My pride and my dignity

At school, we sometimes chanted a melody

For example, we would sing:

*All Arab countries are my homeland—All Arabs are my <a>family</a></em>*[[MM1]](index.html#_msocom_1) **

We drew Arabs, their heads held high,

Their chests breaking the roaring wind. Dressed in robes, respectably.

We were just kids, emotions running high

We ran wild with stories of our Arab bravery

And how our lands stretched <a>endlessly</a>[[MM2]](index.html#_msocom_2) 

And how our wars were for the sake of the Aqsa Mosque so <a>holy</a>[[MM3]](index.html#_msocom_3) 

And how the Zionists, devils with tails, were our enemy

And how the armies of our nation, like a flood, were <a>rising</a>[[MM4]](index.html#_msocom_4) 

I’m going to sail when I grow up!

I’ll pass by Bahrain’s beach in Libya

And enjoy dates from Baghdad in Syria

And cross from Mauritania to Sudan

And travel from Mogadishu to Lebanon

In my heart and soul, I tucked those songs away

*All Arab countries are my homeland—All Arabs are my family*

But when I grew up, I got no visa

I did not sail

I was stopped at the window for an unstamped passport

I did not cross

When I grew up,

I did not sail or cross the border

I grew up, but that child did not

Our childhood rankles us

Ideas, the principles of which we learned from you,

The rulers of our Arab World

Our childhood torments us

Did you not run the schools where we grew up?

We learned your curriculums

Did you not teach us

That the sly fox awaits, and will eat the fool’s sheep if he slumbers?

Did you not teach us

That sticks are protected when bundled, but weak when separated?

Why does senseless division rule us?

Did you not teach us: <em>Hold fast to faith in God, and be not divided among <a>yourselves</a></em>[[MM5]](index.html#_msocom_5) *?*

Why do you block out the sun with your flags?

You have divided up our Arab identity among yourselves, like we’re a bunch of cattle!

The child within me opposes you. Opposes you.

We were divided by your hands—may your hands <a>perish</a>[[MM6]](index.html#_msocom_6) !

I am Arab—I’m not ashamed

I was born in green Tunisia, of Omani <a>ancestry</a>[[MM7]](index.html#_msocom_7) 

I am more than 1,000 years old, yet my mother continues to conceive

I am Arab—I own palm trees in Baghdad and my veins run through Sudan

I am Egyptian, from Mauritania, and Djibouti, and Amman

Christian, Sunni, Shi‘i, Kurd, Druze, and ‘Alawi

I don’t memorize the names of leaders because they come and go

We are sick of being scattered when everyone else is uniting

You filled our religion with lies, manipulations, and made-up stories,

Did God bring us together, only for FIFA to divide us?

We have abandoned our religion, regressing into <a>barbarity</a>[[MM8]](index.html#_msocom_8) 

We trust the ignorant among us—We look to fools for a way out

Rulers of our community, the child within me opposes you. Judges you…

Declaring our Arab people united:

Sudan is not split

Nor are the Golan Heights occupied

Nor is Lebanon broken, treating its wounds alone

He gathers pearls from our Arabian Gulf and plants them in Sudan,

From their seeds will grow wheat in the Arab <a>Maghrib</a>[[MM9]](index.html#_msocom_9) 

The people will press olive oil in resilient Palestine

The people of Somalia will drink as much as they want, forever

From our Algeria, he will light unwavering torches

If Sanaa raises a complaint, all our countries are as Yemen

He will escape from your robe—may God protect it—to the public, burning with passion

He is the public—not you

He is the authorities—not you

Do your armies hear me?        

Do the offices of the institutions in your government hear me?

He is the authorities—not you—I fear none of you

He is Islam—not you—enough of your swindling

Or he’ll leave

Be afraid! This is a patient people

But if the camel is slaughtered, you will have neither its milk nor its calf

I will remain, and my principles will remain

We have been served barrels of injustice

We have been served invocations of ignorance

We have grown tired of this drink and of those who serve it

I warn you! We will remain, despite your conflicts, for this is a united people

Your bonds, while they weaken, God’s remains steadfast

I will grow up, leaving for the child my brush and paints

He will remain to paint Arabs, their heads held high,

And the sound of my songs will remain

*All Arab countries are my homeland—All Arabs are my family*
