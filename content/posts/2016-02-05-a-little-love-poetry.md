One of the most inspiring couples I know of in contemporary Arabic literature are the writers Mourid Barghouti and Radwa Ashour.

So it was hard when Radwa Ashour [passed away](http://www.melaniemagidow.com/?s=radwa+ashour&submit=Go) in 2014: I would miss her writing and her activism. And I could only imagine how much her family would miss her. One of her husband’s responses to her passage represents for me their constant attitude of gratitude and love:

42 years in the company of Radwa Ashour. Yes. Life can be that generous

I recently got the opportunity to read Barghouti’s collection of poetry, *Midnight* (or, my translation, *Middle of the Night*), available in Arabic-English parallel translation. It was another shared project for the couple, Barghouti writing the poetry and Ashour translating it to English. My comments on the collection are [here](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/17927850-palestine-midnight-and-other-poems). In this post, I just want to share my favorite excerpts of love poetry…

*Take me now!*
</br>
* Take me, no one but you, to the window of your morning*
</br>
* so that we can see from it together:*
</br>
* so I can see the roads as less arduous.*
</br>
* Girl, take me*
</br>
* that we may both become more disturbing to the institution of love*
</br>
* and more defiant*
</br>
* than I could bear to be*
</br>
* alone.           *                            – My rendition ( p. 144)

On the value of human connection:
