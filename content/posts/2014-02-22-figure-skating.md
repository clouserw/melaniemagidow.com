I just learned of Zahra Lari, an accomplished young figure skater of the UAE:

<iframe title="Emirati figure skater, Zahra Lari, graces the ice" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVqh96PeQs?start=55&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Beautiful!

This could be a great “culture” video in an Arabic class. In fact, I learned of the video from [Laila Familiar’s site](http://arabicculture.pbworks.com/w/page/75394544/Emirati%20figure%20skater%2C%20Zahra%20Lari%2C%20graces%20the%20ice) where she collects videos for Arabic.
