Dr. Reem Bassiouney’s [latest work of fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43351763?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Ta9NgsrJMj&rank=1) is a masterful, multi-generation epic set in Mamluk Cairo (1309-1517). The action moves out of Cairo at times, to Alexandria, Greater Syria, or the Western Desert, but it is focused around several historic buildings of Mamluk Cairo. There are also brief scenes from 2005-2017. For me, the heart of the book lies in the first of the three main stories, set in the 14<sup>th</sup> century.

The book contains three main tales: *Awlad al-Nas */
Children of the People, *Qadi Qaws* / A Qadi Named Qaws, and *Hadithat
al-Layali* / Nocturnal Mishaps. Together they combine Bassiouney’s careful
historical research with the finesse of a talented storyteller. The first
section is named for *Awlad al-nas*, a name used in 14<sup>th</sup>-c.
Egypt to refer to the children of Mamluk rulers. While Mamluks were born in
Anatolia and imported to Egypt, their children were born in Egypt and were
known as ‘children of the people.’ Often these children’s parents were not from
Egypt, although in some cases, one of the parents was Egyptian. The identity of
the children resulting from these unions was open to speculation, depending on
the social climate.

The story *Awlad al-Nas* tells a tale of a Mamluk ruler who chooses a bride from a middle-class Egyptian family. It is the first in a series of unusual choices he makes. Together this couple affects the fate of their country and they leave their mark on history. Their names are inscribed in the Cairo mosque of Muhammad b. Abdullah al-Muhsini where they were entombed with their loved ones. This opening tale of love and adventure, for me, was the most thrilling part of the trilogy. The characters are believable, their dialogue both meaningful and natural. The story pulls the reader along with surprises and a clear narrative arc. It also examines and reimagines the experiences of boys who were captured and enlisted into Mamluk service and the ways that they were, and were not, integrated into society in Cairo.

After the couple’s death, there follows a tale of their
creative son and his adventures. This section, beginning in 1353, is most
significant, in my reading, for its representation of a historical period as
well as a key theme of Bassiouney’s writing. This son is obsessed with
architecture and the desire to design and build an architectural marvel. This
theme appears in other work by Bassiouney (as in her novel *Mortal Designs*
/ *Ashiya’ ra’i‘a*), as well as others’ work, such as *The Architect’s
Apprentice* by Elif Shafak. Characters in these works follow aspirations of
art in order to fulfill their need to create, to memorialize their patrons, and
to contribute to their civilization. This section considers the life of the
artist. What responsibilities do artists have? How does creativity affect
family life? How does it affect society?

*Qadi Qaws* / A Qadi Named Qaws opens in 1388 with a *qadi*
(religious judge) named Qaws facing a time of tense power struggles between
clerics and rulers in Mamluk Cairo. Bassiouney captures this internal strife in
the Muslim establishment beautifully, showing what it must have felt like for
ordinary Egyptians, complete with her sense of humor: “For the first time, the
Coptic Christians and Jews looked at Muslims with eyes of pity and
understanding. Their lot was certainly worse!” (p. 289, my translation). Three
women come to visit the *qadi*, presenting two legal cases and requesting
his intervention. These two cases will lead to horrors and delights for the
unsuspecting *qadi*. The historic *madrasa* / school of the Sultan
Hasan Mosque also appears in this story.

The Mamluk era comes to a close with the coming of the
Ottomans in 1517. The final tale weaves together three eyewitness accounts of
this tumultuous era (1517-1522) by: a woman named Hind, a man named Salar, and
a scholar named Mustafa. This final tale includes the dark terror of this time,
but like the others, it also tells a story of human endurance and the
commitments that bring people together against the odds.

There is plenty of social diversity throughout the trilogy, touching on issues of racism (such as a preference for lighter skin or for Turkish instead of Arabic), interreligious tensions (both within a community and between communities), different religions (including a Christian character and some characters who do not necessarily practice any religion), and marginalization of women practicing “magic.” This last theme also appears in Bassiouney’s earlier work (*Mortal Designs* / *Ashiya’ ra’i‘a*). Each tale includes a love story, woven in amidst action, intrigue, suspense, and history. The last two pages of the book suggest that these stories of love are also stories of healing, offering hope, warmth and meaning in the lives of mortals consumed by daily toil and turmoil. The collection is characterized by a deep respect for spiritual life and values. It also asks questions about identity, responsibility, and what happens when people realize that their attitudes, ideas, or actions are no longer in alignment with their personal values. The history is meticulously researched by Bassiouney. This trilogy gives new life to historic Mamluk Cairo for all of us to learn from and enjoy.
