I have a new translated short story online at K1N [here](http://k1nlitra.ca/k1n/article.php?opt=3&i=MTQ3&i2=MTM=&l=En) !

The author, Somaya Ramadan, and I discussed its publication ages ago. It’s nice to have it see the light of day at last. This story comes from a fun volume titled *Qalat al-Rawiya* / قالت الراوية / What She Said, which consists of stories written by women in Cairo with the purpose of retelling tradition, reimagining canonized stories and telling new stories with traditional flavors and new ideas.
