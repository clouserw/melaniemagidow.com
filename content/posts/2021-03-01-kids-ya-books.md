**Spanish Bonus: **

I’ve been enjoying reading bilingual (Spanish/English) books by Lynn Reiser with my 4-year-old, especially *The Lost Ball/La pelota perdida*. For myself, I’ve started the young adult novel *La Ciudad de las Bestias* (City of the Beasts) by Isabel Allende. It’s also available in audiobook form.
