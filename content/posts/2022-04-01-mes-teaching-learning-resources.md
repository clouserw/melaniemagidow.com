If you teach anything related to the region of Middle East/Southwest Asia and North Africa or you want to learn more yourself, this post is for you!

My colleague Christine Baker assisted with the design of the course outline provided [here](/images/35376-course.outline.mes100.pdf). Intended for an Introduction to the Middle East course, it provides many sources for learning about the region’s cultures, history, languages, religions, and societies.

In addition, I’d like to remind educators of Teaching the World, a collection of Title VI National Resource Centers (NRCs). NRCs provide outreach to K-14 students and teachers. There are NRCs for many different regions, but here is a link to the Middle East section:

You can find links here to learn more about the individual NRC programs and to access teaching/learning materials.
