### Several people have asked me for suggested reading from Moroccan literature. Here are some ideas…



#### For language learning:

- Sakulich, Aaron. *Moroccan Arabic: Shnoo the Hell is Going on Hnaa? A Practical Guide to Learning Moroccan Darija* (2009)

#### Novels:

- Mhani Alaoui’s two novels: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25438706-dreams-of-maryam-tair?from_search=true">*Dreams of Maryam Tair: Blue Boots and Orange Blossoms*</a> (2015) for fiction with modern Moroccan history and magical realism, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40311712-aya-dane">*Aya Dane*</a> (2018) for contemporary fiction beginning in Boston and exploring creativity, identity, and displacement.

- Hamdouchi, Abdelilah. *The Final Bet: An Arabic Detective Novel* 2008 translated by Jonathan Smolin (Arabic: *Al-rihān al-akhīr* 2001)

- Lalami, Laila. *Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits* (2005) – a novel about contemporary Moroccan society, written by a Moroccan-American author

- Toufik, Ahmed. *Abu Musa’s Women Neighbors* – a historical novel set in medieval Morocco, including mystics, romance, and shipwreck

#### Memoirs:

- Abouzeid, Leila. *Year of the Elephant* 1989 (Arabic: *‘Ām al-fīl* 1983) – from the independence era of the 1950s. You can read [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/272161184?type=review#rating_21059724).

- Mernissi, Fatima. *Dreams of Trespass* (1995) – a famous feminist, sociologist, and social critic writes about her childhood in a traditional home of Fes in the 1940s.

#### Short stories:

- Mohammed Zefzaf is well known for his short stories depicting daily life, but they’re not published in English yet to my knowledge. I found three stories in translation in an article, and would be happy to send a copy on request.

- Clark, Peter, ed. *Sardines and Oranges: Short Stories from North Africa*. London: Banipal Books, 2005. (includes Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia)

- Barrière, Loïc. *Des nouvelles du Maroc*. Paris: Editions Eddif; Editions Paris-Méditerranée, 1999. Just in case you read French…

#### Folk Literature:

- El Koudia, Jilali. *Moroccan Folktales*. Syracuse: Syracuse UP, 2003.

- Peyron, Michael, trans. and ed. *Berber Odes: Poetry from the Mountains of Morocco* – a beautiful little collection!

#### For Kids:

- Evan Turk, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27206454-the-storyteller?ac=1&from_search=true">*The Storyteller*</a> (2016)
