[Discretion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157499390-discretion?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=5VrVg3xwhK&rank=2) by Faïza Guène | The best Algerian novel to my knowledge, it recounts the experience of an Algerian family fitting into life in Paris. Likeable characters, provides a view of Algerian colonial and postcolonial experience. Available in French and English. I picked this up after reading an interview with the author [here](https://themarkaz.org/the-markaz-review-interview-faiza-guene/). I was struck by her comment that there are very few likeable Arab men in literature, but there are plenty in real life. I agree and thought she did a great job representing some overall good guys (the father and son in this family, which happens to have more women than men in it). The English translation is excellent.

[The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61294937-the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=0CxuFSPV9P&rank=1) by Shannon Chakraborty | Historical Fantasy. This is fantasy fiction, but Shannon Chakraborty is such an erudite history nerd that this one needs a new genre. A strong woman pirate and mother saves the day, with lots of historical and literary references and nonstop adventure.

<a href="/images/4a18e-gharibat.alhusayn.png">![](/images/Gharibat.alHusayn-150x150.png)</a>

[Gharibat al-Husayn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463462?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12) by Ahmed Toufiq | Historical fiction from Morocco, with a focus on Andalusian music in Morocco during the French Protectorate. Includes diplomatic intrigue, adventure, and romance. Currently available only in Arabic. See my review on Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3717911186)

<a href="/images/71f4c-tuyur.aylul_.png">![](/images/Tuyur.Aylul_-150x150.png)</a>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12742948?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=o6cKI7mLma&rank=1">*Tuyur aylul* </a>/ September Birds by Emily Nasrallah. I love her writing, but I wouldn’t suggest this (her 1st novel) to most readers. But if you’re a fan of hers, her audiobooks are lyrical and nostalgic; it’s a pleasure to hear her voice. Currently available only in Arabic. I listed to it on Audible.

## Crime Thriller

<a href="/images/05201-unknown.beloved.png">![](/images/Unknown.Beloved-150x150.png)</a>

[The Unknown Beloved](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58769587-the-unknown-beloved?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=jEldHntsz1&rank=1) | Amy Harmon’s latest includes the investigation of 1920s Chicago gangsters and a 1930s Cleveland serial killer, as well as romance and intuitive gifts (the viewing of auras and “reading” of cloth for evidence of its past wearer/s). It is fascinating and suspenseful with stunning characters.

## Fantasy

<a href="/images/3c540-hanging.city_.png">![](/images/Hanging.City_-150x150.png)</a>

[The Hanging City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63127235-the-hanging-city?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=fZ7hc2amPW&rank=1) | Charlie N. Holmberg’s new novel explores what happens when a woman enters a troll city and must be resourceful in order to survive. Fresh ideas, compelling characters, and a happy ending 🙂

<a href="/images/7a8f8-whispering.wood_.png">![](/images/Whispering.Wood_-150x150.png)</a>

[Elemental Blessings Series](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=elemental+blessings&ref=nav_sb_noss_l_19) | I just found out about this series by Sharon Shinn this year and it’s now a favorite (women characters, nature magic). I think it would appeal to readers of Juliet Marillier (adult, not YA). The latest book in the series (#5 [Whispering Wood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/190013474-whispering-wood?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=LrU0PsCq71&rank=1)) just came out.

[Elfhame](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30619786-elfhame?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_14) by Anthea Sharp | Indie-Published Fantasy for those who enjoy fairytales. Last year, I started actively seeking out indie-published books that seemed worth recommending. As I help clients navigate publishing, sometimes I need to advise authors on the various options available. The indie market is growing and I’m interested to observe its development within the publishing industry as a whole.

[I’ll Love You from Afar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56755572-i-ll-love-you-from-afar?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=TkGb2AvR0v&rank=1) | At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, during the initial lockdown period, Racha Mourtada in Lebanon created this beautiful and heartfelt kids book to express love from afar, particularly between far-flung friends and family. It’s still sweet and soothing for little ones. If you read it before bed, it’s a reminder that even when loved ones aren’t in the same room, they still care (helpful for little ones going to sleep in a different room from other loved ones).

Pliska | This is a rollicking rhyming book and really takes you to Cairo if you have connections/memories to the Nile and “Umm al-dunya.” Fun and sweet.

<a href="/images/0f4d8-egyptian.lullaby.png">![](/images/Egyptian.Lullaby-150x150.png)</a>

[Who Left the Light On?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38926365-who-left-the-light-on?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_21) By Richard Marnier | Delightful translation from the French by Emma Ramadan with plenty of rhyme and whimsy. Includes fun illustrations by Aude Maurel, with a special foldout page.
