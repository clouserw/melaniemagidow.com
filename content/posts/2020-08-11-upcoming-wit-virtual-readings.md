It’s August, and time once again to celebrate **Women in Translation (#WiT) Month**! This initiative was started six years ago by blogger Meytal Radzinski with the purpose of focusing on translating words by women or nonbinary authors and working toward gender parity in literary publishing—so important to freedom of expression throughout the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has opened up opportunities to include translators and the authors they translate in a virtual reading format, showcasing participants who might otherwise not have been able to travel to such an event in the past.

Organized under the aegis of the [PEN America Translation Committee](https://pen.org/current-members/translator-resources/) and hosted by [Jill! A Women+ in Translation Reading Series](https://www.jillreadingnyc.com/), this event will bring together five translators joined by their authors, working in such varied languages as Guatemalan Spanish, K’iche’, Hebrew, Arabic, Galician, and Senegalese French. The reading, moderated by Anna Dinwoodie, will be followed by a brief Q&A discussion (time permitting). We hope you’ll join us for this one-of-a-kind bilingual reading!

**On AUGUST 13, at 1pm ET**, tune in for the first LIVE bilingual readings by translators from Guatemalan Spanish & K’iche’, Hebrew, Arabic, Galician, and Senegalese French. This reading will be livestreamed; you can RSVP and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JillReadingNYC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">**tune in via the Facebook page of our host, Jill: A Women+ in Translation Reading Series**</a>.
