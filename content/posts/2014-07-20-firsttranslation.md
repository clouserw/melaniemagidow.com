Having started to translate my first novel from Arabic to English, I’ve been inspired to make a post here about translation. It’s a science and an art–tedious, but also very satisfying when you feel that you’ve succeeded.

Here’s a great [article](http://ajammc.com/2014/07/08/rewriting-hafez-persian-poetry/) about translatability and the work of the translator.
