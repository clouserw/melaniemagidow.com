Update 2020: For remote Arabic study options, see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nf_3-vYLI7rlaqcGI5J8GmdDvf-jTxB4).

Update May 2019:

For advanced Arabic study (such as CASA), apply for [this scholarship](https://www.industryarabic.com/scholarship/)! If you teach, tell your students. Bravo to [Industry Arabic](https://www.industryarabic.com/) for this important support!

For any other study abroad needs, feel free to contact me for case-by-case information. I intent to update the Arabic program information listed here in the future!

Here is my ongoing list of reputable Arabic programs for study outside of college classrooms (summer study, independent study). Please feel free to comment if you have experience with these or other programs that should be listed.

**Egypt** (Unfortunately, political unrest may render Egypt a poor choice for study abroad this year. Syria is not currently listed, for the same reason. May Egyptians and Syrians be granted more political stability and civil rights.)
