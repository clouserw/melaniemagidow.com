I’m teaching a new introductory Arabic community class at The Collective. We had a great time last night at the first session! The remaining four sessions are on the following Thursdays (all 7-8 pm at [The Collective](https://www.thecollective401.com/)): Th. 2/22, Th. 3/1, Th. 3/8, and Th. 3/15.

The fee-based class was organized by parents who want their children to have a chance to learn foreign languages.

I was surprised when one of the owners of The Collective asked me if I’d like to teach a community class for beginning Arabic, because all my teaching experience has been in the context of colleges and universities, but I think community classes are a great idea. We had nine people show up, ranging in age from pre-teen to mature adult. It was a joy to rediscover the Arabic alphabet with members of my community here in Rhode Island.
