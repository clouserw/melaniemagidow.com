For English speakers beginning to learn Arabic, the most popular and most effective book is *Alif Baa* by Brustad, Al-Batal, and Al-Tonsi. Based on the order of its vocabulary, here are some materials that I like to use for providing cultural input in Arabic class:

#### Unit One

- *Salam‘alikum* by [Jil Jilala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jil_Jilala) from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HFiUq7q3oc)

#### Unit Three

- *Kifak ya inta* by [Feirouz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairuz) from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAk-SIFmwus)

*To be continued…*
