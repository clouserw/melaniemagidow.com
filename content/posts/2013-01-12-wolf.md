Tarif Khalidi posted this with the intriguing comment that it’s “from an anthology of Arabic literature, ancient & modern, verse & prose, all my own translations, which should be completed in a couple of years or so.” Happy Saturday! ~ m.

Al-Buhturi (d.897)

**The Poet and the Wolf**

What a night!
</br>
Dawn at its tail-end
</br>
Like an inch of gleaming steel,
</br>
When a sword is drawn from its sheath.

I wrapped myself in its gloom,
</br>
While wolves were still in slumber,
</br>
My eyes like a night thief’s, a stranger to sleep,
</br>
Stirring up the grouse where they squatted,
</br>
The fox and the viper my only companions.

Suddenly, a grey wolf!
</br>
Eye-catching, forepart and ribs upturned,
</br>
Limbs at his sides lanky, spindly,
</br>
Dragging behind him a rope-like tail,
</br>
His spine crooked, bent like a bow.

Creased by hunger, his resolve had hardened:
</br>
Nothing but bones, spirit and hide.
</br>
He crunched his fangs, in whose rows lurked death,
</br>
Like the crunching of one shivering from the cold,
</br>
Teeth chattering.

He rose to view.
</br>
As famished was I as he,
</br>
In a wilderness that never knew a life of ease.
</br>
There, both of us were wolves,
</br>
Each scheming against his mate:
</br>
My luck against his.

He growled then sat on his haunches;
</br>
My war chant enraged him;
</br>
He charged, like lightning followed by thunder.
</br>
I let fly an arrow that missed its mark,
</br>
Its feathers, you would imagine, like the tail of a shooting star,
</br>
In a night of blackest darkness.

But he merely grew in daring and resolution,
</br>
And I knew for sure he was in earnest.

So I followed with another, burying the arrowhead
</br>
Where heart, terror and malice are lodged.

He collapsed, for I had led him to the fountain of death,
</br>
Thirsty still. If only that fountain had been sweet!

I rose, gathered some pebbles and roasted him thereat,
</br>
The fire beneath him of glowing embers.
</br>
Mean was the meal I made of him,
</br>
And I left him, covered in dust, forlorn.
