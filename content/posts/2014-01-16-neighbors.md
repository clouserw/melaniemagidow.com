I’m opening a space here for connections to more information about languages and cultures that neighbor Arabic: Persian, Turkish, and Hebrew to start. Feel free to send me any recommendations!

For Persian culture / art / history, see [Caroline Mawer’s blog](http://www.carolinemawer.com/). For literature in translation, Words without Borders (July 2013) has an issue dedicated to literature post-(1979) revolution.
