For the Marhaba Language Expertise blog, see "Blog" in top right corner. This accumulation of blog posts are retained here for easy reference. They were part of a business (2018-2024) that provided Arabic to English translation (Academic and Literary), Editing (English), and related Consulting.

For my work on Moroccan Malhun Poetry or the calendar I maintain for MENA Lit readings (on goodreads.com), see the "Special Projects" links below. Thanks for your interest!
